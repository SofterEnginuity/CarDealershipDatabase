# CarDealershipDatabase
This application is to manage the data we have for our Car Dealerships (previous project). This is to connect the pieces together so that when information that we receive is stored and able to be utilized later for various purposes, including filtering and reports. This project was especially fun because I was able to integrate various software such as SQL in a way that I had not before!
